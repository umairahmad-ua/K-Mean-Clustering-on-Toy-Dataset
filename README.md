# K-Mean-Clustering-on-Toy-Dataset
This project has been given a Toy data set of items, with features of City, Gender, Age,  Income and Illness. We categorize those items into groups. For that we use the KMeans  algorithm and categorize the items into k groups of similarity by calculating Euclidean distance  as measurement.
